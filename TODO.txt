TODO (Travis, Jared, or Derek):
	- Add limitation to the tile the user can select, they should only be able to select those they are adjacent to (as of now, they can click/interact with anything)
    - Build out the "Player inventory"
		- Not quite sure how we want to do this... Maybe some small thumbnails of the items you have in the "inventory" section, or maybe another screen pops up with more details when you click some "view inventory" button
	- Add some sort of "End Game" state, E.g. after X amount of sols passes by, the game ends (the ship arrives) and determine who wins the game
	- Make the random ship crashes randomly occur at different moments in the game, (after some x amount of turns it happens)
		- Make the ship carry some random inventory item
	- Add in some sort of "daily penalty/reward" functionality, that displays some sort of modal at the beginning of each players turn
	  showing them any health penalties (from not being in their shelter or something), food and water consumption, other random events that happened to them.
	- Build out the Shelter to have some sort of "sleep/rest/take-shelter" button instead of harvest
	- Build out the Farm to possibly require some sort of "plowing/seeding/watering/harvesting" functionality
	- Build out the Lab to require different materials for research, etc.
	-

BUG Fixes:
    - Fix the issue with the player clock that doesn't make it the other players turn once your "day" is up until you click somewhere else

TODO (LINDSAY, or anyone else if they are feeling creative):

(Images that need to be created)
Note: Please make all images 100 X 100 px unless otherwise specified
Note: Please make all images with a transparent background, and center the non transparent part, (so things don't look misaligned when placed in the game)

INVENTORY:
    - Water icon
    - Stone icon
    - Etc...
