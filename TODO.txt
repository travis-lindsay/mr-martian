TODO (Travis, Jared, or Derek):
	- Build out the "Player inventory"
		- Additional items, e.g. hammer to make you build stuff faster
		- Tooltips, descriptions in lab so you know what the item actually does
	- Add some sort of "End Game" state, E.g. after X amount of sols passes by, the game ends (the ship arrives) and determine who wins the game
	- Make the random ship crashes randomly occur at different moments in the game, (after some x amount of turns it happens)
		- Make the ship carry some random inventory item
	- Build out the Farm to possibly require some sort of "plowing/seeding/watering/harvesting" functionality
	- Build out the Lab to require different materials for research, etc.
	- (Good Jared or Derek one) Add ability to input custom player names on menu screen.
	- Figure out what we want to do when a player dies, (e.g. skip their turn and change player icon? Let them play as an alien? Etc).
	- Add weapons you can build in lab for endgame

Ideas:
	- For the end of game, (after like 20-30 sols or something), your 'ship' is coming to pick you up finally (if you survived), but you have
	to play one final 'space-invaders-esque' game where you use the tools and things you built in the lab to blast away aliens or meteors or something
	that are coming to get you before your ship gets to you. This way the game ends (unlike Tycoon Jones), and you have something to look forward to / build for
	and it ends in an intense 'oregon-trail-style' fashion, and we can give them their overall score / placement compared to their other players.
	This way the solo mode also makes sense, because then they can try and achieve a higher score.
	- Eventually, we can write some backend API that stores high scores and such, so they can see how they rank.

Story:
	- You are there researching, setting up camp and getting a base established.
	- For multiplayer (which should be the ideal way to play anyways), each player represents a different space/tech/research company
		- hence why your all competing, etc.
	- Sol 5 or something, the political situation changes and the martians send a mob after you to take you out.
		- Ship needs time to recharge before you can leave again
	- Sol 10 your boss tells you they came up with a way to better your odds, by adding propaganda to other companies buildings
		- 1 alien in end game per propaganda
	- Sol 15, they say you won't have time and will need to prepare to defend your ship
	- Sol 20, the reckoning
	- End game scoring, who did the most research, most health, ship health, morale, buildings, etc.

BUG Fixes:
    - Figure out how to handle two players being on the same tile, (e.g. have one peek out a little so they don't overlap).
    - Fix weird styling issues in Mozilla, (e.g. border on tiles not showing like in chrome)
	- Fix event dialog for building events (swap out building dialog for event dialog instead of layering them)

TODO (LINDSAY, or anyone else if they are feeling creative):

(Images that need to be created)
Note: Please make all images 100 X 100 px unless otherwise specified
Note: Please make all images with a transparent background, and center the non transparent part, (so things don't look misaligned when placed in the game)
Note: When making sprite sheets, please stick with 100 px height X whatever multiple of 100 px for the width

INVENTORY:
	- Anti-alien propaganda
    - Water icon (like a water droplet, with some sort of circular backdrop I think would look rad)
    - Stone icon (for what is mined)
    - Etc...
STORY:
	- Intro slides:
		- After months of travel your space station has finally arrived. Mars.
		Your years of training has prepared you for this moment to finally be able to set foot on the red planet, 
		and gain some much anticipated (and protected) information regarding life on the planet.
			- (Picture of space station orbiting around Mars)
		- Once thought to be uninhabited, several races of intelligent life have since been discovered to be thriving on the planet.
		However, years of poorly executed inter-planetary politics have raised tensions higher than ever between Earth and Mars.
		Amidst this aggressive political climate, you've been given a rare opportunity by your corporation to carry out research on the planet.
			- (picture of Space ship flying to mars with spaceman inside)
		- You've arrived, you've been designated by your employer to setup a research camp. But first you must setup everything you'll need to survive.
