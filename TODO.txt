TODO (Travis, Jared, or Derek):
    - Build out the "Player inventory"
		- Not quite sure how we want to do this... Maybe some small thumbnails of the items you have in the "inventory" section, or maybe another screen pops up with more details when you click some "view inventory" button
	- Add some sort of "End Game" state, E.g. after X amount of sols passes by, the game ends (the ship arrives) and determine who wins the game
	- Make the random ship crashes randomly occur at different moments in the game, (after some x amount of turns it happens)
		- Make the ship carry some random inventory item
	- Build out the Farm to possibly require some sort of "plowing/seeding/watering/harvesting" functionality
	- Build out the Lab to require different materials for research, etc.
	- Figure out what players can do to interact with other players buildings, (e.g. destroy them, steal from them, do nothing to them, etc)
	    - Just brainstorming, I was leaning towards being able to steal from them, and making the players add security components to their buildings.
	- (Good Jared or Derek one) Add ability to input custom player names on menu screen.
	- Figure out what we want to do when a player dies, (e.g. skip their turn and change player icon? Let them play as an alien? Etc).
	- Add some sort of benefit to having an upgraded shelter, increase morale, (decrease morale if in basic shelter)
	- Add some summary text to the 'mission progress' modal, that give an intro statement, potential tips, or just other random info which
	  changes each time a new sol passes.
	- Add additional functionality to the SolEvent class, and add in other random events that increase decrease health, give you random items, etc.

Ideas:
	- For the end of game, (after like 20-30 sols or something), your 'ship' is coming to pick you up finally (if you survived), but you have
	to play one final 'space-invaders-esque' game where you use the tools and things you built in the lab to blast away aliens or meteors or something
	that are coming to get you before your ship gets to you. This way the game ends (unlike Tycoon Jones), and you have something to look forward to / build for
	and it ends in an intense 'oregon-trail-style' fashion, and we can give them their overall score / placement compared to their other players.
	This way the solo mode also makes sense, because then they can try and achieve a higher score.
	- I'm thinking that the 'Lab' should allow you to build certain tools, components and things that will benefit you both in the main game
	play as well as the end of game. Such as the rover, (cuz we already have images for it), and that lets you move faster or something.
	Possibly other tools / weapons depending on what the end 'mini-game' thing ends up being.
	- Eventually, we can write some backend API that stores high scores and such, so they can see how they rank.

BUG Fixes:
    - Figure out how to handle two players being on the same tile, (e.g. have one peek out a little so they don't overlap).
    - If player clicks on tile they are currently on, change it so they don't move a tile away then back again.
    - Fix weird styling issues in Edge, Mozilla, (e.g. border on tiles not showing like in chrome)

TODO (LINDSAY, or anyone else if they are feeling creative):

(Images that need to be created)
Note: Please make all images 100 X 100 px unless otherwise specified
Note: Please make all images with a transparent background, and center the non transparent part, (so things don't look misaligned when placed in the game)
Note: When making sprite sheets, please stick with 100 px height X whatever multiple of 100 px for the width

INVENTORY:
    - Water icon (like a water droplet, with some sort of circular backdrop I think would look rad)
    - Stone icon (for what is mined)
    - Etc...
