TODO (Travis, Jared, or Derek):
    - Build out the "Player inventory"
		- Not quite sure how we want to do this... Maybe some small thumbnails of the items you have in the "inventory" section, or maybe another screen pops up with more details when you click some "view inventory" button
	- Add some sort of "End Game" state, E.g. after X amount of sols passes by, the game ends (the ship arrives) and determine who wins the game
	- Make the random ship crashes randomly occur at different moments in the game, (after some x amount of turns it happens)
		- Make the ship carry some random inventory item
	- Build out the Farm to possibly require some sort of "plowing/seeding/watering/harvesting" functionality
	- Build out the Lab to require different materials for research, etc.
	- Figure out what players can do to interact with other players buildings, (e.g. destroy them, steal from them, do nothing to them, etc)
	    - Just brainstorming, I was leaning towards being able to steal from them, and making the players add security components to their buildings.
	- Add ability to input custom player names on menu screen.
	- Figure out if switching to Typescript is a good idea, (more intuitive inheritance, OOP stuff)?
	- Figure out what we want to do when a player dies, (e.g. skip their turn and change player icon? Let them play as an alien? Etc).
	- Add some sort of benefit to having an upgraded shelter, increase morale, (decrease morale if in basic shelter)
	- Make the upgrades require other resources, (e.g. something from the mine, extra food, whatever).
	    - Make a tooltip that goes over the disabled upgrade button that shows what is required to upgrade, and enable the button if they can upgrade.

BUG Fixes:
    - Figure out how to handle two players being on the same tile, (e.g. have one peek out a little so they don't overlap).
    - If player clicks on tile they are currently on, change it so they don't move a tile away then back again.
    - Fix weird styling issues in Edge, Mozilla, (e.g. border on tiles not showing like in chrome)

TODO (LINDSAY, or anyone else if they are feeling creative):

(Images that need to be created)
Note: Please make all images 100 X 100 px unless otherwise specified
Note: Please make all images with a transparent background, and center the non transparent part, (so things don't look misaligned when placed in the game)
Note: When making sprite sheets, please stick with 100 px height X whatever multiple of 100 px for the width

INVENTORY:
    - Water icon (like a water droplet, with some sort of circular backdrop I think would look rad)
    - Stone icon (for what is mined)
    - Etc...
